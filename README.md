# Timeless Toys

An eCommerce app for toys where we offer a variety of toys for all ages.

## Getting Started

This is my mini-project for the comp375 mobile application. You can find the code for my two-page e-commerce application, which I will update with new features as the semester progresses, including integrating Firebase and SQL. 
This repository will hold just phase 1 of the app; any new features will be held in a new repository. Aside from finding the files to run the application, you can also find a Tutorial guide on creating this application yourself. This isn't an in-depth guide; instead, it goes over each page with additional comments and the main ideas each page holds. There will also be an additional tips and tricks guide going over what to consider when creating an application and some UI design tips.
